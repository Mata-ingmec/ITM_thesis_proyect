Language helps speakers to be as vague or as precise as they like. {NLP} Stands for natural language processing. . Natural languages are those languages that are spoken by the people.Natural language processing girdles everything a computer needs to understand natural language and also generates natural language.Natural language processing ({NLP}) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics mainly focuses on the interactions between computers and human languages or natural languages. {NLP} is focussed on the area of human computer interaction. The need for natural language processing was also felt because there is a wide storage of information recorded or stored in natural language that could be accessible via computers. Information is constantly generated in the form of books, news, business and government reports, and scientific papers, many of which are available online or even in some reports. A system requiring a great deal of information must be able to process natural language to retrieve much of the information available on computers. Natural language processing is an interesting and difficult field in which we have to develop and evaluate or analyse representation and reasoning theories. All of the problems of {AI} arise in this domain; solving "the natural language problem" is as difficult as solving "the {AI} problem" because any field can be expressed or can be depicted in natural language.},
